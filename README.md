This VSCode Extension will attach itself to your Version Control Panel and will show you 5 different commit messages based on your git diff output!

If you are not sure which suggestion to pick, this extension also provides a summary of all the five suggestions.

## Usage

1. Enter your OpenAI Private Key, you can get yours [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Open VSCode's Source Control window.
3. Stage the changes for which you want to generate the commit message.
4. On the collapsible section "Auto Commit" click on the button corresponding to the project.
5. Et voil√†! You will have both the five suggestions and the summary. You can easily copy them to your clipboard by clicking on the icon to the right of each suggestion.

## Disclaimer

Harnessing the power of the AI should always come with responsibility. As such, do not blindly copy-paste the suggestions since the results may not be 100% appropiate with the prompt in this extension.

Nonetheless, as OpenAI's models keep improving drastically, this extension's effectiveness may be greatly improved with new models and other prompts. If you find a prompt that delivers a better result, please do not hesitate to create an issue in this repo!
